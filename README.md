# Marketing Refactor Challenge

## Description

The Marketing Refactor Challenge--the first challenge in the coding boot camp--was an example of an on-the-job ticket. Starter code was provided, and the assignment was to refactor it. The site was given a descriptive title, a broken navbar link was fixed, the HTML code was updated to use semantic tags, and image ```<alt>``` tags were added to improve accessibility. The CSS file was modified to align with the new HTML tags, reorganized to follow the semantic structure, consolidated to eliminate redundancies, and commented properly.

The goal was to improve the accessibility and functionality of the webpage without changing its content or styling.
